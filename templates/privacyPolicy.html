      <h2>3. General Information and Mandatory Information</h2>
      <h3>Data Protection</h3>
      <span>The operators of these pages take the protection of your personal data very seriously. We treat your
        personal data confidentially and in accordance with statutory data protection regulations as well as this
        privacy policy.</span><br><br>
      <span>When you use this website, various personal data is collected. Personal data is data by which you can be
        personally identified. This privacy policy explains what data we collect and what we use it for. It also
        explains how and for what purpose this happens.</span><br><br>
      <span>We point out that data transmission over the Internet (e.g., when communicating by email) can have security
        gaps. Complete protection of the data against access by third parties is not possible.</span><br><br>

      <h3>Note on the Responsible Party</h3>
      <span>The responsible party for data processing on this website is:</span><br><br>
      <span>Lutz Bölling<br>
        Christian Klemm<br>
        Lars Tieseler</span><br><br>
      <span>Phone: 015221958743<br>
        Email: exactstack@gmail.com</span><br><br>
      <span>The responsible party is the natural or legal person who, alone or together with others, decides on the
        purposes and means of processing personal data (e.g., names, email addresses, etc.).</span>
      <br><br>
      <h3>Storage Duration</h3>
      <span>Unless a more specific storage period is specified within this privacy policy, your personal data will
        remain with us until the purpose for data processing no longer applies. If you make a legitimate request for
        deletion or revoke your consent to data processing, your data will be deleted unless we have other legally
        permissible reasons for storing your personal data (e.g., retention periods under tax or commercial law); in the
        latter case, deletion will take place after these reasons cease to apply.</span>
      <br><br>
      <h3>General Information on the Legal Basis for Data Processing on this Website</h3>
      <span>If you have consented to data processing, we process your personal data on the basis of Art. 6 para. 1 lit.
        a GDPR and Art. 9 para. 2 lit. a GDPR if special categories of data are processed according to Art. 9 para. 1
        GDPR. In the case of explicit consent to the transfer of personal data to third countries, data processing is
        also based on Art. 49 para. 1 lit. a GDPR. If you have consented to the storage of cookies or access to
        information in your device (e.g., via device fingerprinting), data processing is additionally based on § 25
        para. 1 TDDDG. Consent can be revoked at any time. If your data is required for contract fulfillment or for the
        implementation of pre-contractual measures, we process your data on the basis of Art. 6 para. 1 lit. b GDPR.
        Furthermore, we process your data if required to fulfill a legal obligation on the basis of Art. 6 para. 1 lit.
        c GDPR. Data processing may also be based on our legitimate interest according to Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR.
        The relevant legal bases in each individual case are explained in the following paragraphs of this privacy
        policy.</span>
      <br><br>
      <h3>Recipients of Personal Data</h3>
      <span>In the course of our business activities, we work with various external parties. This may also involve the
        transfer of personal data to these external parties. We only share personal data with external parties if this
        is necessary for contract fulfillment, if we are legally obliged to do so (e.g., transfer of data to tax
        authorities), if we have a legitimate interest under Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR in sharing the data, or if
        another legal basis permits the data transfer. When using processors, we only pass on personal data of our
        customers on the basis of a valid processing contract. In the case of joint processing, a contract for joint
        processing will be concluded.</span>
      <br><br>
      <h3>Revocation of Your Consent to Data Processing</h3>
      <span>Many data processing operations are only possible with your explicit consent. You can revoke consent you
        have already given at any time. The legality of data processing carried out until the revocation remains
        unaffected by the revocation.</span>
      <br><br>
      <h3>Right to Object to Data Collection in Special Cases and to Direct Advertising (Art. 21 GDPR)</h3>
      <span>IF DATA PROCESSING IS BASED ON ART. 6 PARA. 1 LIT. E OR F GDPR, YOU HAVE THE RIGHT AT ANY TIME, FOR REASONS
        ARISING FROM YOUR PARTICULAR SITUATION, TO OBJECT TO THE PROCESSING OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA; THIS ALSO APPLIES TO
        PROFILING BASED ON THESE PROVISIONS. THE RESPECTIVE LEGAL BASIS ON WHICH PROCESSING IS BASED CAN BE FOUND IN
        THIS PRIVACY POLICY. IF YOU OBJECT, WE WILL NO LONGER PROCESS YOUR AFFECTED PERSONAL DATA UNLESS WE CAN
        DEMONSTRATE COMPELLING LEGITIMATE GROUNDS FOR THE PROCESSING WHICH OVERRIDE YOUR INTERESTS, RIGHTS, AND FREEDOMS
        OR THE PROCESSING SERVES TO ASSERT, EXERCISE, OR DEFEND LEGAL CLAIMS (OBJECTION PURSUANT TO ART. 21 PARA. 1
        GDPR).</span>
      <span>IF YOUR PERSONAL DATA IS PROCESSED FOR DIRECT MARKETING PURPOSES, YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO OBJECT AT ANY TIME
        TO THE PROCESSING OF PERSONAL DATA CONCERNING YOU FOR THE PURPOSE OF SUCH ADVERTISING; THIS ALSO APPLIES TO
        PROFILING INSOFAR AS IT IS ASSOCIATED WITH SUCH DIRECT ADVERTISING. IF YOU OBJECT, YOUR PERSONAL DATA WILL
        SUBSEQUENTLY NO LONGER BE USED FOR DIRECT MARKETING PURPOSES (OBJECTION PURSUANT TO ART. 21 PARA. 2
        GDPR).</span>
      <br><br>
      <h3>Right to Lodge a Complaint with the Competent Supervisory Authority</h3>
      <span>In the event of violations of the GDPR, data subjects have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory
        authority, in particular in the Member State of their habitual residence, their place of work, or the place of
        the alleged violation. The right to lodge a complaint exists without prejudice to other administrative or
        judicial remedies.</span>
      <br><br>
      <h3>Right to Data Portability</h3>
      <span>You have the right to have data that we process automatically on the basis of your consent or in fulfillment
        of a contract handed over to yourself or to a third party in a commonly used, machine-readable format. If you
        request the direct transfer of the data to another controller, this will only be done insofar as it is
        technically feasible.</span>
      <br><br>
      <h3>Information, Correction, and Deletion</h3>
      <span>Within the framework of the applicable legal provisions, you have the right at any time to free information
        about your stored personal data, its origin and recipient, and the purpose of the data processing and, if
        applicable, a right to correct or delete this data. For this purpose, as well as for further questions on the
        subject of personal data, you can contact us at any time.</span>
      <br><br>
      <h3>Right to Restriction of Processing</h3>
      <span>You have the right to request the restriction of processing of your personal data. You can contact us at any
        time for this purpose. The right to restriction of processing exists in the following cases:</span>
      <ul>
        <li>If you dispute the accuracy of your personal data stored by us, we usually need time to verify this. For the
          duration of the review, you have the right to request the restriction of processing of your personal data.
        </li>
        <li>If the processing of your personal data has been/is unlawful, you may request the restriction of data
          processing instead of deletion.</li>
        <li>If we no longer need your personal data but you need it to exercise, defend, or assert legal claims, you
          have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your personal data instead of deletion.</li>
        <li>If you have objected pursuant to Art. 21 para. 1 GDPR, a balance must be struck between your and our
          interests. As long as it is not yet clear whose interests prevail, you have the right to request the
          restriction of processing of your personal data.</li>
      </ul>
      <span>If you have restricted the processing of your personal data, such data – apart from being stored – may only
        be processed with your consent or for the establishment, exercise, or defense of legal claims or for the
        protection of the rights of another natural or legal person or for reasons of important public interest of the
        European Union or a Member State.</span>
